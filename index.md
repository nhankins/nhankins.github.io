# By declaring these variables, you can include a portfolio showcasing your work and organize your portfolio's items into a custom layout, all without adding any CSS. In addition, you must 1) create an HTML file in the_includes folder for each project with the text you'd like to display, and 2) create a YAML file in the _data folder describing the order in which each project should be shown and categorized. See `/includes/example.html` and `/_data/work.yml` for examples.

portfolio: project and work experience # the heading for your portfolio and title of your YAML file
portfolio_description: Current Employment- Generative AI/LLM and Language Specialist at Innodata, Inc.

Side Projects- RAG Fine-Tuned Language Learning LLM, Figurative Language Classification, Legal Data Summarization, Jeopardy LLM, among others. Please feel free to follow my Github link at the bottom of this webpage for my growing portfolio of projects.

Master's capstone project- I looked for specific influential linguistic features by analyzing the cross-lingual transfer of contextualized word embeddings with mBERT. The code and paper was presented, completed, and uploaded on my Github at the end of my last semester of graduate school in May 2023. 

My specific contributions as a Freelance Contractor and Graduate Assistant have included annotation, creation, and evaluation of English data for downstream ML tasks. In addition, I created 15+ lesson plans and tutoring session for teaching introductory and advanced Python classes for NLP applications. # a description to be desplayed below the heading and above the content

[//]: # (write a bit about yourself here)

I'm a Computational Linguist from New Jersey, USA. I completed my MS in Computational Linguistics at Montclair State University in May 2023 and currently work as a Language Specialist for Generative AI/LLM projects. I've been researching and conducting language model experiments since around the advent of transformer architecture in 2017, and continue to learn new aspects every day.

After completing my BA in Linguistics with a minor in TESOL at the University of New Hampshire in 2019, I decided to accept a position to teach English abroad at a high school in France for a school year.  Upon returning to the U.S., I decided to continue pursuing my passion for languages, while concurrently pursuing my interest in computer science with linguistic applications.

I've also found learning languages to be a rewarding subject for lots of reasons. I've seen firsthand how languages can be a uniting factor in facilitating conversations between people. It can be a bridge to understanding new cultures and I intend to dedicate my career to helping to uncover ways to bring people together in mutual respect and appreciation.
