[//]: # (write a bit about yourself here)

I'm a 25-year-old linguist from Flemington, NJ. I'm currently studying to complete my master of science in Computational Linguistics at Montclair State University. At Montclair, I am a Graduate Assistant where I help faculty as a TA and in completing annotations for research projects. My expected graduation date is in May 2023.

 After completing my BA in Linguistics at the University of New Hampshire in 2019, with a minor in TESOL, I decided to accept a position to teach English abroad at a high school in France for a school year.  Upon coming back, I decided to continue pursuing my passion for languages, while concurrently pursuing my interest in technology and computer science.

I've also found learning languages to be a rewarding subject for lots of reasons. I've seen firsthand how languages can be a uniting factor in facilitating conversations between people. It can be a bridge to understanding new cultures and I intend to dedicate my career to helping to uncover ways to bring people together in mutual respect and appreciation.
